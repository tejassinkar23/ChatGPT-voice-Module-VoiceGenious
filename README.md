The code provided is a voice assistant program that allows users to interact with an AI-powered assistant.
It uses OpenAI's GPT-3 language model to generate responses to user queries. The pyttsx3 library is used for
text-to-speech conversion, enabling the assistant to speak the generated responses. The speech_recognition library
allows the program to listen to and understand user's spoken commands. The webbrowser module enables the program
to open web browsers and visit specific URLs. Additionally, the code utilizes the googletrans library to translate
the generated responses from English to Marathi. The program sets up an API key, initializes necessary components,
and defines functions for generating responses, speaking the responses, and translating text.
The main loop continuously listens to user input, generates responses, translates them, and speaks the translated
response back to the user.
